ANSWERS:
Now, two servers have been set up, each of which has its own web server, application server, codebase, and database. This will be beneficial in the event of a high volume of traffic or a failure in one of the servers. Additionally, a High Availability (HA) proxy load balancer has been implemented. This will distribute traffic between the two servers through either a Weighted Round Robin or a Weighted Least Connection method. An Active-Active system is being used, meaning that should one of the servers fail, requests will not be sent to it until it passes a health check; the other server can then take on the functions. Furthermore, the use of a primary replica and a secondary replica has been implemented. The primary replica is a node that is allowed to host a read-write availability database, while the secondary replica maintains a full backup copy of the primary server and hosts a read-only availability database. Should a failover occur, the secondary replica will assume the primary role, with or without a guarantee of data protection. 

However, there are still some issues with the infrastructure. It is still dependent on one client, over the network. Additionally, if the two servers reside in the same datacenter, they could be running on the same power source. Moreover, there are security issues as the system is using HTTP which is not secure as data is being transferred without encryption. Furthermore, there is no firewall, meaning that any incoming traffic has access to the data. Finally, there is no monitoring being done, meaning that there is no way of knowing the status of the web, how fast it is working, or if it is returning errors.
